# DiscordBots
The Repository contains the code for 2 bots:
- Tracking prices of bobble heads available on target. The data is scrapped and cleaned from target and stored in a notion table. The processed data is then posted on discord channel
- CS-GO bot for giving details for various in-game items as requested by the user. Each user can request the data from the bot in a private view within the channel. The bot uses multi-threading to cater to various requests at the same time.
